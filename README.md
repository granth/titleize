# Titleize

* http://rubygems.org/gems/titleize

## DESCRIPTION:

Adds `String#titleize` for creating properly capitalized titles.
It can be called as `Titleize.titleize` or `"a string".titleize`. It is also
aliased as `titlecase`.

The list of "small words" which are not capped comes from the New York Times 
Manual of Style, plus 'vs' and 'v'.

If loaded in a Rails environment, it modifies `Inflector#titleize`. By default 
ActiveSupport calls `Inflector#underscore` and `Inflector#humanize`. This however
can be problematic with words like "iPod", "GPS", and "McArthur". To disable 
this behavior, use the options `:underscore => false` and `:humanize => false`.

Based on [TitleCase.pl](http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/title_case) by John Gruber.

## SYNOPSIS

`a lovely and talented title".titleize # => "A Lovely and Talented Title"`

## INSTALL

`gem install titleize`
